Q. How does the .NET framework work?

	The .NET framework is a platform for building, deploying, and running applications. It 
provides a runtime environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which 
manages the execution of code and provides services such as memory management, thread 
management, and security.

When you build a .NET application, you write code in a language such as C# or VB.NET. This 
code is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) by a language compiler. The IL code is 
then compiled into machine code by the CLR at runtime. This process is known as just-in-
time (JIT) compilation.

The .NET framework also includes a library of classes, called the .NET Framework Class 
Library, which provides a wide range of functionality that you can use in your applications. 
This library is organized into namespaces, which group related classes together.

In addition to the CLR and the .NET Framework Class Library, the .NET framework includes 
other components such as Windows Forms for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and 
ASP.NET for building web applications.

Overall, the .NET framework provides a comprehensive development platform for building, 
deploying, and running a wide range of applications on the Windows operating system.
