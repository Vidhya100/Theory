1.Difference between .NET Standard, .NET Core and ASP.NET.

.NET Standard is a set of APIs that are common to multiple .NET implementations, 
such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin. It allows developers to write code 
that can be used on multiple platforms, without having to worry about the 
underlying implementation details.

.NET Core is a cross-platform, open-source implementation of .NET that can be used 
to build applications for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes a runtime, a set of 
libraries, and a set of tools for developing and running applications.

ASP.NET is a framework for building web applications and APIs. It can be used with 
either .NET Framework or .NET Core. ASP.NET supports multiple programming 
languages and can be used to build web applications and APIs that run on Windows, 
Linux, and macOS.

In summary, .NET Standard is a set of APIs that are shared by multiple .NET 
implementations, .NET Core is an implementation of .NET that can be used to build 
cross-platform applications, and ASP.NET is a framework for building web 
applications and APIs.
