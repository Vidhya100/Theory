Q. Tracing, Debugging, Error Handling 
->
	Tracing, debugging, and error handling are important tasks that are involved in 
developing and maintaining software.

Tracing is the process of recording information about the execution of an application, such 
as the values of variables or the flow of control. Tracing can be used to understand how an 
application is working, or to diagnose problems that occur during execution.

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in an application. Debuggers are tools 
that allow you to execute an application one line of code at a time, inspect the values of 
variables, and set breakpoints to pause the execution of the application at a particular point.

Error handling is the process of anticipating and responding to errors that can occur during 
the execution of an application. This can involve trapping errors, logging error information, 
and recovering from errors in a graceful manner.

Overall, tracing, debugging, and error handling are essential skills for developing and 
maintaining software. They help you to understand how your application is working, find 
and fix problems, and ensure that your application runs smoothly.
