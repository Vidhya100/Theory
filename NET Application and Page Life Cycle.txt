Q. .NET Application and Page Life Cycle 
->
	In the .NET Framework, an application and its pages go through a series of steps, 
known as the application and page life cycle, as they are requested and served. These steps 
are common to all ASP.NET applications and provide a way to hook into the life cycle of an 
application and its pages to perform custom tasks.

*The application life cycle consists of the following steps:
1.Application start
2.Application end

*The page life cycle consists of the following steps:
1.Page request
2.Start
3.Initialization
4.Load
5.Validation
6.Rendering
7.Unload

Each of these steps corresponds to a method in the life cycle of an application or page. For 
example, the Application_Start method is called when the application starts, and the 
Page_Load method is called when a page is requested.

You can override these methods in your application or page to perform custom tasks. For 
example, you might override the Page_Load method to load data from a database and bind 
it to a control on the page.

The life cycle of an application and its pages is important to understand because it 
determines when certain tasks are performed, and it provides a way for you to hook into 
the life cycle to perform custom tasks.
