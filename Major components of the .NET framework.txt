Q. Major components of the .NET framework
->
		The .NET framework consists of several components that work together to 
create a development platform for building, deploying, and running applications.
Here are some of the major components:
1. Common Language Runtime (CLR): This is the runtime environment that manages 
the execution of .NET code. It provides services such as memory management, 
thread management, and security.

2. .NET Framework Class Library: This is a library of classes, interfaces, and value types 
that are provided as part of the .NET framework. It includes a wide range of 
functionality, such as file input/output, database connectivity, and XML parsing. 

3. Common Language Specification (CLS): This is a set of guidelines that are followed by 
all .NET languages to ensure that they can interoperate with each other. It defines a 
set of rules for language designers to follow, so that code written in one .NET 
language can be used in another .NET language.

4. Windows Forms: This is a user interface (UI) framework for building graphical 
applications. It provides a set of UI controls and layout containers that you can use to 
build a UI for your application.

5. ASP.NET: This is a web application framework that allows you to build dynamic, 
interactive websites and web applications. It includes a server-side scripting 
language (ASP.NET), a rich set of UI controls, and support for connecting to a wide 
range of data sources.

6. DO.NET: This is a data access technology that enables you to connect to, query, and 
update data from a wide range of sources, including databases, data files, and web 
services.

7. Windows Communication Foundation (WCF): This is a framework for building 
distributed, service-oriented applications. It allows you to build applications that 
communicate with each other over a network, using a variety of different 
communication protocols.
