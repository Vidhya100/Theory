HTTP protocol and HTTP commands ->
	The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol is a standard for sending and 
receiving data over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to 
transmit data between clients and servers, such as web browsers and web servers.

HTTP uses a client-server model, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server 
sends a response back to the client. The request and response are both in the form of HTTP 
messages, which consist of a start line, headers, and a message body.

Here are some common HTTP commands:

1.GET: This command is used to retrieve a resource from the server. For example, a 
web browser might send a GET request to a server to retrieve a webpage.

2.HEAD: This command is similar to GET, but it only retrieves the headers of a 
resource, rather than the entire resource.

3.POST: This command is used to submit data to the server, such as form data or a file 
upload.
4.PUT: This command is used to upload a resource to the server.

5.DELETE: This command is used to delete a resource from the server.

6.CONNECT: This command is used to establish a tunnel to the server for the purpose 
of establishing a secure connection.

7.OPTIONS: This command is used to request information about the options that are 
available for a particular resource.

8.TRACE: This command is used to perform a message loopback test to the server.

9.PATCH: This command is used to apply a partial modification to a resource.
